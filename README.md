# UncomplicatedCustomRoles
Add custom roles to your server in a more efficient, easy and fast way!

## â„¹ This plugin will support [UncomplicatedCustomAbilities](https://github.com/DrAgenda/UncomplicatedCustomAbilities)

**EXILED >= 8.2.0**
## Installation
Download the `UncomplicatedCustomRoles.dll` from the latest relase and put it in your `Plugin` directory.

## How it works
**UncomplicatedCustomRoles** provides the ability for server owners to implement as many custom roles as they prefer in a simple and intuitive method.<br>
Unlike **CustomRoles**, **UCR** also provides a system that allows you to define in all the necessary parameters for complete role customization such as the roles it can replace, role, name and spawn location!

## UCR for Devs
**UCR** implements an API system that allows registration, spawning and other features, so we have documented the API in two parts:
- [Register a new UCR role](https://github.com/FoxWorn3365/UncomplicatedCustomRoles/wiki/Register-a-new-UCR-Custom-Role)
- [API Docs](https://github.com/FoxWorn3365/UncomplicatedCustomRoles/wiki/API-Docs)

## UCR for Server owners
- [Create a custom role (YAML)](https://github.com/FoxWorn3365/UncomplicatedCustomRoles/wiki/Create-custom-roles)
- [Spawn settings](https://github.com/FoxWorn3365/UncomplicatedCustomRoles/wiki/Spawn-settings)
